- [ ] (from 2020-11-04): look at changing names of blackList/whiteList in meld core codebase Â (dev branch)
    - see [issue #1](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-testing-ssi3/issues/1)
    - [x] created local "unblacking" branch from git-meld-2.0 branch
    - [x] proposed name changes - see issue
    - [ ] discuss new name choices with team
    - [ ] apply name changes to codebase
    - [ ] see if anything breaks
    - Basic changes done, hello-meld-3 app still works.  PR submitted: awaiting feedback.
        - https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-clients-core/pull/16

- [ ] Have local branch of `meld-clients-core` running with up-to-date node packages.  Babel still has obsolete dependencies: I believe this is slated to be fixed in next major version.

- [x] (from 2020-11-04): set up project for MELD testing
    - [x] create project on GitHub: https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-hello-meld
    - [x] experiment with testing frameworks
        - leaning to MochaJS, but for testing node+React server apps, thinking about how the apps should be structured.  Will initially test with "Hello MELD"
    - [x] pick testing framework; MochaJS? (alt JestJS)
    - [x] Create simple test suite for "Hello MELD": https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-hello-meld/tree/main/hello-meld-1
        - NOTE: Testing targets React components, so there is no top-level test for the web page as described by index.jhs
            - This has led to some code refactoring to minimize logic in index.js and move to <App ...> component.
        - NOTE: I may end up including JestJS, as that seems to have some useful capabilities for DOM testing.

- [ ] (from 2020-11-10): work with David/Mark to get MELD simple annotation example running
    - [x] Simple Help MELD app is running, with basic score rendering.
    - [ ] Add selectable score to "Hello MELD" family
        - see [issue #2](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-testing-ssi3/issues/2)
        - have created hello-meld-3, which reads configuration from RDF graph, and uses redux integration for this

- [x] (2020-12-09): Refactor graph update logic in hello-meld-3: some of this change could be ported back into meld-clients-core?
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-hello-meld/blob/main/hello-meld-3/src/app.js
        - graphComponentDidUpdate should be generic to any graph traversal
    - https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-hello-meld/commit/921b46a353940375c16fe6535419a5032bd8bb1d#diff-ebad3debbac683d90c3a536e834264de24ccbb757171778569620fe34d349933

    - https://github.com/oerc-music/meld-testing-ssi3/blob/main/Notes/SSI3-draft-report.md
