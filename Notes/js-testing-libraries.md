# Testing libraries

https://geekflare.com/javascript-unit-testing/ - survey
https://designmodo.com/test-javascript-unit/ - another survey, more opinionated?

https://mochajs.org/ - seems popular, flexible, backend and front; works with custom test libraries (via errors?)
https://jasmine.github.io/ - front-end only?
https://qunitjs.com/ - library from jquery - well-liked, but less flexible?
https://theintern.io/ - complex, flexible - probably good for large/complex projects?
https://jestjs.io/ - "focus on simplicity" - Facebook-maintained - preferred for react
https://github.com/avajs/ava - node only? minimalistic, fast, ...?

https://karma-runner.github.io/5.2/index.html - flexible test runner - works with mocha, etc

https://www.chaijs.com/ - useful assertion library

https://sinonjs.org/ - mocking framework?  
- "Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.  Works with any unit testing framework."
